# Prompt AI
Prompt generator using the OpenAI API (https://openai.com/api/)

## How to use
In the text area, type a short prompt and click submit. For the best results, make sure to be as specific as possible. An example button is provided to show a few possible prompts you can try. Once submit is clicked, a response will be generated and shown below.

### Key functions implemented
Responses are saved to local storage. This means that responses will be saved even after leaving or refreshing the page. To clear the storage, click the remove all prompts button or click the trash can icon to remove a single prompt. 

Another function implemented was the ability to see examples. This was done by making an example button able to toggle.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
